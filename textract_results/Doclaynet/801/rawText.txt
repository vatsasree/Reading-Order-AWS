vibrations may indicate to the clinician holding fluid flow sensor 16 that fluid is or is not,
respectively, flowing from catheter 12 to fluid pump 18. In examples in which a flow rate
of fluid flow corresponds to a magnitude or frequency of vibrations, a change in
magnitude or frequency of vibrations may indicate to the clinician holding fluid flow
sensor 16 that a fluid flow rate is changing.

Catheter 12 may be removed from the vasculature once the procedure is
complete.

As the thrombus is suctioned from the blood vessel through an inner lumen of
catheter 12, fluid flow sensor 16 may provide the clinician operating aspiration system 10
with a haptic indication of fluid flow that indicates a condition related to engagement of
the thrombus. FIG. 5 is an illustrative example graph of fluid flow versus time for an
example aspiration procedure using aspiration system 10. such fluid flow being used to
generate vibrations in fluid flow sensor 16.
[0087]
In the example of FIG. 5. the clinician may position the at least one opening
36 of catheter 12 near the thrombus, such that the thrombus partially blocks the at least
one opening 36 (Ti). As a result of this partial blockage, the flow of fluid from catheter
12 to fluid pump 18, and thereby through fluid flow sensor 16. may be reduced. In
examples in which a frequency or magnitude of vibrations generated by fluid flow sensor
16 corresponds to a flow rate of fluid through fluid flow sensor 16. this reduction in flow
rate may cause a corresponding change in magnitude or frequency of vibrations, thereby
providing an indication to the clinician that the thrombus has been at least partially
engaged.
[0088]
In the example of FIG. 5, as the thrombus becomes further engaged, the
thrombus may fully or substantially fully block the at least one opening 36 of catheter 12
(T2). For example, a flow of fluid may continue to decrease as a thrombus is drawn into
catheter 12 and begins to more fully block the at least one opening 36 of catheter 12. In
examples in which fluid flow sensor 16 is configured to produce vibrations above a
particular fluid flow threshold ("Threshold"), at a certain reduction in fluid flow, fluid
flow sensor 16 may produce vibrations that are below a haptic level of the clinician, or
may produce no vibrations at all. This lack of haptic feedback may indicate to the
clinician that flow of fluid has stopped or substantially stopped, thus indicated that the
thrombus is fully engaged by catheter 12. In some examples, not shown in FIG. 5. the
thrombus may be removed by removing catheter 12 while the thrombus is fully engaged
with catheter 12.
