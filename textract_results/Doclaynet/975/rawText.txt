On these larger airplanes, the CG is identified as being at a
location that is a specific percent of the mean aerodynamic
chord (% MAC). For example, imagine that the MAC on
an airplane is 100". and the CG falls 20" behind the leading
edge of the MAC. That means it falls one-fifth of the way
back, or at 20 percent of the MAC.
Figure 6-54 shows a large twin-engine commercial transport
airplane. The datum is forward of the nose of the airplane,
and all the arms are being measured from that point. The CG
for the airplane is shown as an arm measured in inches. In
the lower left corner of the figure, a cross section of the wing
is shown, with the same CG information being presented.
To convert the CG location from inches to a percent of MAC.

for the airplane shown in Figure 6-54, the steps are as follows:
1.
Identify the CG location. in inches from the datum.

each other, the chord of the wing is the same along the wing's
