The condition is more prevalent when there are gaps between

combination of these.
When drilling combinations of composite parts with metal
parts, the metal parts may govern the drilling speed. For
example, even though titanium is compatible with carbon/
epoxy material from a corrosion perspective, lower drilling
speeds are required in order to ensure no metallurgical
damage occurs to the titanium Titanium is drilled with low
speed and high feed. Drill bits suitable for titanium might not
be suitable for carbon or fiberglass. Drill bits that are used
for drilling titanium are often made from cobalt-vanadium:

as No. 40 drill. which are used to manually drill pilot holes,
are typically used because carbide drills are relatively brittle
and are easily broken. The relatively low cost of these small
HSS drill bits offsets the limited life expectancy. High-speed
steel drill bits may last for only one hole.
The most common problem with carbide cutters used in hand-
drill operations is handling damage (chipped edges) to the
cutters. A sharp drill with a slow constant feed can produce
a 0.1 mm (0.004-inch) tolerance hole through carbon/epoxy
plus thin aluminum, especially if a drill guide is used. With
hard tooling, tighter tolerances can be maintained When the
structure under the carbon/epoxy is titanium, drills can pull
