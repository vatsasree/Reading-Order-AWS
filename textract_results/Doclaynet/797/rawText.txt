Control of Tori
In this section. we will numerically demonstrate the stabilization of the unstable quasi-periodic motions
embedded in the chaotic attractor of the unidirectionally coupled Duffing oscillators [5.11] + 5.14 +
5.17) We suppose that to stabilize the quasi-periodic solutions of 5.14 and 5.17 it is sufficient to
control the chaos of system (5.11) For that purpose we will make use of the Ott-Grebogi-Yorke (OGY)
control method 9 applied to the logistic map (5.10) which gives rise to the presence of chaos in [5.11].
We proceed by briefly explaining the OGY control method for the map [69].
Suppose that the parameter r in the logistic map 5.10 is allowed to vary in the range [3.9 E. 3.9+
where e is a given small number. Consider an arbitrary solution { Ko E [0. 1], of the map and denote
by J - 1,2 p. the target unstable p-periodic orbit to be stabilized In the OGY control method
[69] at each iteration step i after the control mechanism is switched on. we consider the map 15.10 with
the parameter value l = X1, where
(6.18)
provided that the number on the right-hand side of the formula (6.18) belongs to the interval [3.9-8, 3.9+
3.9[2x(3)
