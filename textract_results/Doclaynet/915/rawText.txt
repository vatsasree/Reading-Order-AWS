PSORIASIS AND ACNE - A DAWNING OF A NEW DAY. PEOPLE OFTEN CONSIDER
SKIN DISORDERS SUCH AS PSORIASIS OR ACNE TO BE MERELY COSMETIC CONCERNS. DEPENDING
ON THEIR SEVERITY, HOWEVER, THESE CONDITIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT AN INDIVIDUAL'S
SELF-ESTEEM, WILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN ACTIVITIES AND QUALITY OF LIFE.
WITH PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM MODERATE TO SEVERE PSORIASIS AND ACNE IN MIND,
ALLERGAN HAS MADE OUR TAZAROTENE MOLECULE THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR SKIN
CARE BUSINESS TAZAROTENE REMAINS THE FASTEST GROWING RETINOID ON THE MARKET.
THE OBJECTIVE OF ALLERGAN'S TARGETED SKIN CARE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
HAS BEEN TO EXPAND THE USE OF OUR TAZAROTENE MOLECULE BY MAKING IT ORALLY
AVAILABLE. IN 2003, WE COMPLETED TWO PHASE III TRIALS WITH ORAL TAZAROTENE IN
PATIENTS WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE PSORIASIS. THE TESTS INVOLVED 690 PATIENTS TAKING
4-5 MILLIGRAMS OF TAZAROTENE DAILY FOR 12 WEEKS, FOLLOWED BY 12 WEEKS OF FOLLOW-
UP. MORE THAN HALF OF THE PATIENTS TAKING ORAL TAZAROTENE SAW THEIR PSORIASIS
SYMPTOMS IMPROVE BY 50 PERCENT, AND 30 PERCENT IMPROVED AT LEAST 75 PERCENT.
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS WERE MAINTAINED DURING THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD.
FEWER THAN 5 PERCENT OF THE TREATED PATIENTS DISCONTINUED THERAPY DUE TO
SIDE EFFECTS, WHICH INCLUDED INFLAMMATION AND CRACKING OF THE LIPS, DRY SKIN,
HEADACHE AND ACHES AND PAINS.
