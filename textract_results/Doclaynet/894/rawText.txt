between the main wheels and the tailwheel (L) is 222 inches,
The CG location is a negative value, which means it is 88.2
inches forward of the datum. This places it 13.2 inches
and the total net weight (W) of the airplane is 1,218 pounds.
Since the datum is aft of the main wheels, use the formula
forward of the main wheels, exactly the same location as
when it was measured from other datum locations
