In formula (All). Rb represents a hydrogen atom. a halo-
gen atom, or an alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms
As the examples of preferred substituents that the alkyl group
15
represented by Rbo may have, a hydroxyl group and a halogen
atom are exemplified. As the halogen atom represented by
Rb a fluorine atom, a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, and an
iodine atom are exemplified Rbo preferably represents a

(Rb2)nz
hydrogen atom. a methyl group. a hydroxymethyl group. or a
20
trifluoromethyl group. and especially preferably a hydrogen
atom or a methyl group.
Ab represents a single bond, an alkylene group, a divalent
linking group having a monocyclic or polycyclic alicyclic
25
hydrocarbon structure, an ether bond, an ester bond, a carbo-
nyl group, or a divalent group of combining these groups, and
LC1-15
preferably a single bond or a linking group represented by

Ab, represents a straight chain or branched alkylene group,
or a monocyclic or polycyclic cycloalkylene group, and pref-
erably a methylene group, an ethylene group, a cyclohexylene
group, an adamantylene group, or a norbomylene group.
V represents a group having a lactone structure. Specifi-
LC1-16 35
cally, V represents a group having a structure represented by
any of formulae (LC1-1) to (LC1-17).

The lactone structural part may have or may not have a
substituent (Rb2). As preferred substituents (Rb2), an alkyl
group having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl group
having from 4 to 7 carbon atoms, an alkoxyl group having
from 1 to 8 carbon atoms, an alkoxyearbony group having

from 2 to 8 carbon atoms, a carboxyl group, a halogen atom,
a hydroxyl group, a cyano group, and an acid-decomposable
group are exemplified, and more preferred substituents are an
alkyl group having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a cyano group, 60
and an acid-decomposable group. n2 represents an integer of
O to 4. When n2 is 2 or more, each substituent may be the same
with or different from every other substituent A plurality of
substituents (Rb2) may be bonded to each other to form a ring.

As repeating unit having a lactone structure, a repeating
unit represented by the following formula (All) is preferred.
