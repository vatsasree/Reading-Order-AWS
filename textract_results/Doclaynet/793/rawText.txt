We learn that the H=-mediated contribution is only associated with the factor rp and it
depends on the species of lepton due to the appearance of ne. Since noo nD, and ne are all
free parameters, in order to make the results be more predictive, we can adopt a simple
scenario. As mentioned earlier, nu, and nD play the role of cot B and tan B in the type-II
THDM, respectively. If the new H=-mediated effects would like to satisfy the constraints of
current data such as b sy, it is plausible to set /mul << 25 As a consequence,
rp could be simplified by
(18)
Intriguingly, in this plain scenario we the dependence of lepton flavor in rp can be
ascribed to the phase factor OD, Since OD, are the new physical phases, in general, they
cannot be rotated away. If we enforce ND, = tan B, we see that the magnitude of charged
Higgs effects is the same as that in type-II THDM. In other words, apart from the new phase
factor PD, we do not introduce a new enhanced factor.
In order to display the new physics effects numerically, we investigate the influence of
charged Higgs on RK for Ke2. on fD.rb for D -> l+ve decays and on BR for B
l+ve,
respectively. Using Eqs. (91 and (16), the ratio of r(K to r(K can be expressed by
(19)
with = cos() -cos(oc) - where because of the second term in the brackets being much
smaller than unity, we have neglected the terms whose the order is higher than mkn2/m.
The resulted numerical values as a function of n./m and Active are presented in Fig.
The values in the figure denote the ratio REXP/RSM We see clearly that due to the lepton
flavor dependent phases, H=-mediated contributions could modify the SM prediction and
be still consistent with current data.
